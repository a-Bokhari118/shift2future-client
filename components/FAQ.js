              What does Lifetime Access exactly mean?

              Tailwind Master Kits' lifetime access gives you access to the
              components and the code with no additional recurring charges. Pay
              once, use the components forever. Also, if in the future more
              components are added, you get access to them if you're subscribed
              for the lifetime access membership.

              How is One-Year access pass different from Lifetime Access?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm mt-4 font-light leading-6">
              With One-Year pass, you get access to all the premium components
              for One Year and all the updates are for One Year only. With
              Lifetime Access, you get access to the entire set for features for
              Lifetime - Which means you can get future updates for the
              components as long as the website is live.

              Can I resell the components on my own website?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm mt-4 font-light leading-6">
              No. You cannot resell the components on your own website claiming
              that you built them. You cannot create templates out of Tailwind
              Master Kit's components and sell them. You can use the components
              for client projects and personal use.

              our newsletter, we release new components every month.
